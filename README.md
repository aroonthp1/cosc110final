The Cleanliness Rater App is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application created using the Tkinter library in Python. This app allows users to rate the cleanliness of a bus on a scale of 1 to 5 and calculates the average rating based on user inputs. It provides an easy and user-friendly way to collect and display cleanliness ratings.

Features
Rating System: Users can rate the cleanliness of a bus by clicking on buttons labeled from 1 to 5.

Average Calculation: The app calculates and displays the average cleanliness rating of the bus in real-time.

Click on the button that corresponds to your rating of the bus's cleanliness (1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest).

The app will calculate and display the average cleanliness rating at the bottom of the window.

You can continue rating the bus's cleanliness, and the average rating will update accordingly.

To exit the application, close the window.

Code Explanation
The code for the Cleanliness Rater App is organized as follows:

It uses the Tkinter library for creating the graphical user interface.
